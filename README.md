### Course Description: 
Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biologi-
cal sciences. Brief review of statistical methods and their computational implementation for studying time series analysis,
spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal mode decomposition, and image processing
and compression. This repository contains five projects exploring these concepts. The first four projects are done in MATLAB while the fifth project is done in Python.

### Projects:
#### HW 1. An Ultrasound Problem

#### HW 2. Time-Frequency Analysis of Musical Pieces

#### HW 3. PCA Analysis on Paint Can Trajectory

#### HW 4. Music Classification Algorithm

#### HW 5. Neural Networks for Classifying Fashion MNIST
